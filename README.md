# Go E-Invoice Validator

A local validator for synthetic e-invoice documents. It checks schemas, totals, tax
calculations, identifiers, required fields and cross-document consistency, then returns
actionable diagnostics. Runs fully offline; all sample data is synthetic.

**Status: work in progress.** See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) and [PLANS.md](PLANS.md).

## Run

```
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/einvoice
```

Requires Go 1.22+.

Built by a supervised autonomous agent pipeline (nightshift).
